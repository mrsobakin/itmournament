# ðŸ¤º itmournament

*As in `ITMO`, `tournament` and `mourn`.*

Testing system for ITMO C++ battleship tournament.

You'll have to have docker to run it. Also, add yourself to `docker` group to avoid running testing system as sudo.

You use windows and want to run it? [Oh, geez, that too bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NunTJ_k9M14).
